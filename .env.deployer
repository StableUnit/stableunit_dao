# 1) copy this file with key values into .env file
# 2) move .env file outside of git repo folder, for example to '../.env/.env'
# because it's easy to accidentally publish/compromise this file
# 3) if needed, edit envPath values in truffle/hardhat configs to match correct .env file location
# 4) it's advisable to use different wallets for testnet and main-net, and don't keep big sums of money
